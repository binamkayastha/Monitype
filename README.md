# Monitype [IDEA Stage]

Create a way to measure how slowly and inaccurately you actually type while using the computer as apposed to just typing tests.

This program will detect your keypresses, and store words which you type based on the times you hit the spacebar. It detects and "error" based on whether you press backspace on the word or not to correct it.
