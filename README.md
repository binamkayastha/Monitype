Create a way to measure how slowly and inaccurately you actually type while using the computer as apposed to just typing tests.

The program is not meant to run during the time that your computer is on, rather it is supposed to be used to measure "sessions". That way you start the program every time you want to write an essay. This encourages brainstorming and putting your ideas on paper.

Disclaimer: I do not claim any responsibility for any harm or good that this program may cause your research papers, productivity, or anything else.
